# StateMachineWithStateless

**StateMachineWithStateless** is a Unity project that demonstrates the implementation of a state machine using the [Stateless](https://github.com/dotnet-state-machine/stateless) library. This project serves as a practical example of how to leverage state machines to manage complex NPC behaviors in Unity.

## Project Structure

The project contains the following directories and files:


## Features

- **Modular State Management:** Easily configure states and transitions for NPC behaviors such as idle, run, walk, attack, and cooldown.
- **Clear Separation of Concerns:** Each state is defined with its own logic, improving code readability and maintainability.
- **Trigger Management:** The project includes a system for handling state transitions based on triggers, allowing for dynamic behavior changes in response to game events.
- **Example NPC Implementation:** An example soldier NPC showcases various states and interactions, demonstrating the potential for real-time behavior changes based on player proximity.

## Examples
In Scripts, you will find the following examples:

* **[Chest](Script/Chest/)** 
* **[Detector](Script/Detector/)**
* **[Solder](Script/Solder/)**
* **[Switcher](Script/Switcher/)**
